# Cloude ☁️ Agent

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.com/deploy/cloude-agent?referralCode=P5pe6R&utm_medium=integration&utm_source=template&utm_campaign=generic)

Deploy the Claude Code agent to the cloud. Give it a workspace to work with files. Load up skills and commands to extend its capabilities. Invoke via API or webhooks.

One-click template deploy on Railway. Comes with a single-page chat app for interacting with the agent and managing files in the workspace.

## Background

Claude Code is an amazing coding agent and, iykyk, it's actually a fantastic general purpose agent harness. With the Claude Agent SDK, we now have programmatic access. This little project helps deploy the SDK to the cloud and makes it available via API and webhook.

Simply add your preferred skills and slash commands to the workspace and you have a custom agent available 24x7 in the cloud.

Deploy on Railway via a one click template deploy. Comes with a Claude.com style single-page chat UI for interacting with the agent and working with files in the workspace.

## Requirements
- Railway Account
- Anthropic API Key


## Features
- FastAPI-based API for interacting with the agent.
- REDIS for session persistence.
- Chat API with streaming (`/chat/stream`) via SSE and model selection.
- File-aware agent: reads/writes in `/app/workspace` (Railway volume-backed).
- Skill management: list/get/add/delete/upload/download skills.
- Web chat UI (`chat.html`) for easy interaction with the agent and accessing the artifacts it generates.
- Permissions modes: default is `acceptEdits`; toggle `bypassPermissions` in UI (skip dangerously).

## API
- `POST /chat` — non-streaming chat
- `POST /chat/stream` — SSE streaming chat
- `GET /workspace` — list workspace files
- `GET /workspace/{path}` — download workspace file (requires `X-API-Key`)
- `DELETE /workspace/{path}` — delete workspace file
- `GET /skills` — list skills
- `GET /skills/{id}` — get SKILL.md + files
- `POST /skills` — add/update a SKILL.md
- `POST /skills/upload` — upload skill zip
- `GET /skills/{id}/download` — download skill zip
- `DELETE /skills/{id}` — delete skill
- `GET /commands` — list commands
- `GET /commands/{id}` — get command template
- `POST /commands` — add/update a command template
- `DELETE /commands/{id}` — delete a command
- `GET /health` — health check

## Auth
- Set your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in the Railway environment variables - this enables the Claude Agent to use the Anthropic LLM models.
- Create your own API KEY for authentication - this is used to authenticate requests to the API.

## Workspace Files (volume)
- Mounted at `/app/workspace` (Railway volume).
- Agent works in this directory (SDK `cwd` set).
- Chat UI (chat.html) has fully functional file explorer for browsing the workspace and editing files, etc (by making calls to the API).

## Skills
- Skills live on the volume at `$WORKSPACE_DIR/.claude/skills/{skill_id}/SKILL.md` (+ supporting files).
- Skills are **not** baked into the Docker build - they persist on the volume and can be added/modified without redeployment.
- Manage via API or UI (drag/drop zip).
- After uploading skills with scripts, they are automatically made executable on container start.

## Commands (Slash Commands)
- Commands are prompt templates stored at `$WORKSPACE_DIR/.claude/commands/{command_id}.md`
- Invoke via `command` parameter in `/chat`: `{"command": "voice-transcript", "message": "the transcript text..."}`
- Commands use Claude Code’s markdown format (YAML frontmatter + prompt body). Frontmatter `allowed-tools` controls what the command is allowed to run.
- Inside command markdown, use `$ARGUMENTS` (or positional `$1`, `$2`, etc.) to consume the arguments passed after `/{command}`.
- Manage via API: `GET/POST/DELETE /commands` (and/or edit the files on the volume).
- Useful for webhooks that need consistent prompt formatting and reliable routing.

## Webhooks (non-interactive permissions)
Webhook-triggered runs can’t click “approve”, so **any tool that would normally prompt must be pre-approved** or you’ll see errors like “This command requires approval”.

- Use `POST /webhook` to map arbitrary payloads into a session + message, optionally invoking a slash command:
  - Example: `POST <app's railway url>/webhook?api_key=...&command=voice-transcript&session_id=id&message=transcript&raw_response=true`
- Recommended: keep permissions locked down and add explicit allow rules in `.claude/settings.json` (seeded into the volume by `entrypoint.sh`).
- Avoid relying on `bypassPermissions` for production webhooks unless you fully trust the deployment and isolation.

## Running Locally
1) `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
2) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3) `export API_KEY="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"` (or any strong random key)
4) Start Redis (required for `/chat` session/history storage):
   - Homebrew: `brew install redis && brew services start redis`
   - Docker: `docker run -d --name clawed-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7`
5) `export REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"` (default, but explicit is clearer)
6) `uvicorn main:app --reload`
7) Open `chat.html` in a browser (set `API_URL` at top if needed).

### Local Smoke Tests

Health:
```bash
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

Chat (non-streaming):
```bash
curl -sS -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id":"smoke","message":"Say hello world and nothing else.","context":{"permission_mode":"acceptEdits"}}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/chat | python3 -m json.tool
```

If `/chat` returns a 500, run uvicorn with debug logs and re-run the curl without `-f` to see the error:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload --log-level debug
curl -sS -D - -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"session_id":"smoke","message":"Hello","context":{"permission_mode":"acceptEdits"}}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8080/chat
```

## Env Vars
- `API_KEY` (required)
- `REDIS_URL` (default `redis://localhost:6379`)
- `PORT` (default `8080`)
- `WORKSPACE_DIR` (default `/app/workspace`)
- `SKILLS_DIR` (default `$WORKSPACE_DIR/.claude/skills`)
- `COMMANDS_DIR` (default `$WORKSPACE_DIR/.claude/commands`)
- `PROJECT_CONTEXT_PATH` (default `$WORKSPACE_DIR/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
- `MAX_PROJECT_CONTEXT_CHARS` (default `50000`)
- `ALLOW_BYPASS_PERMISSIONS` (default `0`) — set to `1` to allow `permission_mode=bypassPermissions`
- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` (optional) — used by slash commands to generate fully-qualified artifact URLs (defaults to the production Railway URL in the included commands).

## Deployment (Railway)
- Dockerfile installs node + Claude CLI, creates `appuser`, uses entrypoint to `chown` `/app/workspace` before dropping privileges.
- Attach a volume to `/app/workspace` for persistence.
- Run `railway up --detach` to deploy.
- `entrypoint.sh` seeds default `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/scripts/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/settings.json`, and `.claude/CLAUDE.md` into the volume **only if missing** (non-destructive). To pick up image updates, edit the volume files (preferred) or delete the specific file(s) from the volume so they can be re-seeded.

## Notable Files
- `main.py` — FastAPI app and endpoints
- `agent_manager.py` — chat logic, streaming, skills, workspace helpers
- `chat.html` — single-page UI
- `Dockerfile`, `entrypoint.sh` — image and permissions fix
- `.claude/settings.json` — project permission rules used for non-interactive runs (webhooks)
- `.claude/CLAUDE.md` — project context (volume-managed) appended to the system prompt - editable via the chat UI
- `.claude/scripts/` — helper scripts invoked by commands
